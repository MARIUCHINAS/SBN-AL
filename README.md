# SBN-AL
SBN-~~AL~~ - Sort By Number | And letter

## What is this?
This is a encryption algorythm that shifts the number value by the selected value.
For example the letter "a" has a value of 097 so if the selected value is 1 it would become 098 or the letter "b"
Currently only the shifting part of the algorythm the second part will work like this.
there will be a value called first_shaft and second_shaft.
If the value of the first shaft is "abc" and the value of the second shaft is "chb".
Any "a" will be replaced by "c" any "b" will be replaced by "h" any "c" will be replaced by "b" and so on.

## Is this serious?
No this is just a showcase this encryption algorythm it is very easy to crack it takes about 0.04 seconds to crack it.
The reason for it being so easy to crack is because i havent implemented the letter part of the encryption.

## How do i use this?
Its pretty simple you can grab the source code and use it for yourself.
I do not suggest you to use this until the letter part of the algorythm is created.
And even when the letter part of the algorythm is created it will still be easy to crack.
If you do use this you have to follow the license in this case Apache-2.0.
